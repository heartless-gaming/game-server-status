## What it do and how it's done
Simple crapy piece of php code that fetch a json object taken directly from a steamapi call and compare it to the heartless gaming server. Read more about the process of getting your server information on the [Allied Mods forum](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=192367).

## TODO
	- Arrow to deploy the gameserver instance
	- align the game title to the left
	- Add image or art about the game
	- Add a liscence to the code of this project
	- Think about the liscence of the heartlessgaming asset.

## Credit
Valve because their games and tools are awesome.
